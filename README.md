## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using CNN Techniques on Flower Images to classify the flower types into various classes.

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world problem using CNN techniques. We will be Classifying flower images into various classes.

- Business Problem Statement:

We will be classifying flower images with CNN technique. We are using various CNN concepts in this notebook like Data Augmentation, Ablation, Morphological Transformations, Normalisations, Network building, Hyperparameter Tuning etc. to solve this image classification problem

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.
